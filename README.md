# ChessDev

This is a hobby project of mine where I slowly build a working chess engine with (eventually) a working GUI.

The project is built from a tutorial on youtube by Bluefever Software.
Here is the link to the playlist of the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg
